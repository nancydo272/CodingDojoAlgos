//Remove Negatives
// Implement removeNegatives() that accepts an array, removes negative values, and 
//returns the same array (not a copy), preserving non-negatives’ order. As always, do not use built-in array functions.



// Second-to-Last
// Return the second-to-last element of an array. Given [42,true,4,"Kate",7], 
//return "Kate". If array is too short, return null.



// Second-Largest
// Return the second-largest element of an array. Given [42,1,4,Math.PI,7], return 7. 
//If the array is too short, return null.



// Nth-to-Last
// Return the element that is N-from-array’s-end. Given ([5,2,3,6,4,9,7],3), return 4. 
//If the array is too short, return null.



// Nth-Largest
// Liam has "N" number of Green Belt stickers for excellent Python projects. Given arr and N, 
//return the Nth-largest element, where (N-1) elements are larger. Return null if needed.



// Skyline Heights
// Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline. Let’s say you are given an array with 
//heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest to you and extending away. Array [-1,7,3] would represent three buildings: first is actually out of view below street level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories high (hidden behind the 7-story). You are situated at street level. Return array containing heights of buildings you can see, in order. Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7]. Given [0,4] return [4]. As always with challenges, 
//do not use built-in array functions such as unshift().
