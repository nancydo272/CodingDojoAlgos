//A computer is really good at two things. It has a lot of bits which means we can store a lot 
//of different representations. It is also really good at doing some task over and over again. 
//Using this powerful looping power of computers is also know as iteration. 
//You iterate over some block of code over and over again until a condition is met.

var arr = [24, 8, 23, 3];
linearSearch(8, arr);   // => 1
linearSearch(-99, arr); // => false
